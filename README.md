# Classification of Dermatological Images Using Machine Learning Models

This is a current project I am working on with the goal of classifying 7 different classes of dermatoscopic images using the HAM10000 Dataset. 

Models I have tried so far include DeiT and ResNet.

Apologies in advance for the lack of organization of the code. I will update it to include cleaner code in the future.

Cheers.
